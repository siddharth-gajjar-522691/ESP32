# ESP32
The ESP32 a most recommmanded hardware for IoT applications. There are so many Applications for Which I used this hardware. It is So powerful compact and all you need IoT controller.. It has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on board. It is Dual core Microcontroller. Here are some projects I made myself for the Industrial purposes.

Project : Predictive Maintenance For the Ovehead Cranes.

Protocols used: 
Wi-Fi for data logging on the server,
Modbus RS485 For communication with four AC drive to read the real time paramenters like (voltage, current, Power, fucntion time, errors)
SPI Protocol for SD card Communication
I2C Protocol for on board DS3231 RTC communication
Digital OUTPUT for LED Indication of Operation
Analog Input for The device sensor data measurement.
FILE I/O for the data storage during connection lost.

Software/ IDE used: Arduino
Hardware Selection: ESP32 Dev
